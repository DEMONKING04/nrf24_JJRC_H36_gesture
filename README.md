There is an image processing script running on my laptop which is continuously looking for my hand and track its position in the video frame. Once it gets the coordinates of the hand, it sends the respective signal to the drone using Arduino connected to the laptop along with an NRF24L01 2.4GHz Transceiver Module which directly communicates with the receiver board of any R/C Drone.

If you have any doubts, you can let me know!
